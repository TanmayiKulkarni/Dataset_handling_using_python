# Dataset_handling_using_python
Sure! Here's a concise two-paragraph `README.md` for your dataset handling and visualization project:

---

This program demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using Python’s `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries on a global housing market dataset. It includes functions to display dataset information, select subsets of data, and visualize key metrics such as GDP growth and housing affordability through bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and pie charts.

Created as a learning exercise, the program helps practice reading CSV files, indexing, slicing data, and generating various plots to gain insights from real-world data. It’s a foundational example of how to handle and explore datasets programmatically with Python.
